### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 - I am Zahra. Iâ€™m currently working as a back-end developer using Laravel and PHP. I love programming and trying to make new ideas to become real. My favorite language is PHP which I have been working with since university.
 - I like to have a balance between work and life. so I try to do my favorite hobbies besides coding. I do cycling and writing(some of them can be read from <a href="http://sedaye-baran76.blogfa.com/">here</a>).
